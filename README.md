# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This project includes functions to both encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Convert plain text into encrypted text by shifting each letter by a specified amount.
- **Decryption:** Convert encrypted text back into plain text using the same shift value.

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the text by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. Non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- **Plaintext:** `HELLO`
- **Ciphertext:** `KHOOR`

## Functions

### `project(text, shift)`
- **Description:** Encrypts the given text using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Parameters:**
  - `text` (str): The text to be encrypted.
  - `shift` (int): The number of positions to shift each letter.
- **Returns:** The encrypted text as a string.

### `project_decrypt(text, shift)`
- **Description:** Decrypts the given text using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Parameters:**
  - `text` (str): The text to be decrypted.
  - `shift` (int): The number of positions the text was originally shifted.
- **Returns:** The decrypted text as a string.

### `main()`
- **Description:** The main function to run the Caesar Cipher program. It prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption, input a message, and provide a shift value.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
   

2. **Run the script:**
   bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   

3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Choose to either encrypt or decrypt a message.
   - Enter the message to be processed.
   - Provide the shift value (a positive or negative integer).

## Example

bash
Caesar Cipher Algorithm
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt?: E
Enter the message: Hello World
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog


## Notes

- The shift value must be an integer.
- Uppercase and lowercase letters are handled separately, and the case is preserved in the output.
